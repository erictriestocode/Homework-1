# Homework assignment 1

For this assignment, I'll be attmepting to create a wireframe layout in HTML/CSS for practice. This will mostly be me struggling with CSS.

I'll be doing the assignment in CSS grids, as I've read its the way of the future for most web dev's(not to mention I find it way easier)

I plan on creating the personal page at a later date.
